					The British Empire was the largest Empire in the world during The First World War. 
					At its peak in 1921 (after WW1), Great Britain held around 25% of the world's area.
					With its vast colonies across the globe, the British Empire held a huge amount of resources
					and manpower (as seen in the table above). <br><br>

				<p class = "roboto">			
					Great Britain possessed a legendary navy that had a reputation of being unsinkable. It was 
					larger in size than the next two largest navies combined. However, during WW1, it was challenged,
					although briefly, by the German navy which had been rapidly growing before WW1. During the war however,
					the UK's Royal Navy proved to still be superior and the number one in the world. The Royal Navy allowed 
					Britain to contain the Central Powers inside Europe, preventing them from gaining crucial supplies and 
					resources from other parts of the world.<br><br>
					
					Despite being very large, Britain had trouble completely mobilising all of its troops for the war 
					and its massive size caused Britain's troops to be spread thin over vast amounts of territory. Britain also suffered
					some serious defeats such as at the <a href = "battles/html/#gallipoli">Battle of Gallipoli</a>. Even so, Great Britain 
					was effective and critical to the war effort. The UK invented the tank, first deployed in the <a href = "somme">Battle of the Somme</a>,
					which allowed troops to break through the deadlock created by Trench warfare.

				<p class = "roboto">
					France used to be the strongest land-power in Europe. However, in 1871, Germany was formed by the North German Federation. 
					This significantly changed the balance of power as France now had an extremley powerful rapidly expanding neighbor at its 
					eastern border. Even worse, the North German Federation seized a piece of French territory, Alsasce-Lorraine. The French 
					were declining in both their military and their birth rates compared to Germany. Russia, also fearing Germany, decided to 
					form an alliance with France to contain Germany from the east and west. <br><br>
				
					At the start of the War, the French were not prepared at all for the German juggernaut's assault in the Schlieffen Plan. 
					The French army had ineffective leadership, outdated tactics, was less disciplined, less armed, and less motivated to fight. 
					The French were quickly pushed back and almost got knocked out of the war, as the Germans almost reached Paris. 
					Unlike other Nations in WW1 which already started to wear uniforms that blended in with the environment, the French still wore bright blue 
					uniforms and conducted human wave charges against machine gun fire in the early war.

					However, France managed to survive and stalemate Germany after the <a href = "battles/marne">Miracle on the Marne&sol;Battle of the Marne</a>.
					France eventually adopted a full dark blue uniform and were able to improve their tactics, causing them to perform much better mid and late war.

				<p class = "roboto">
					Russia was and still is a country with massive amounts of land. Russia also has an extremeley high population and an equally massive army. 
					The Russian army was the biggest army in Europe (by numbers). Russia also has massive amounts of resources like coal and lumber. However,
					Russia also has many problems. Its government is corrupt and decaying. Their military is poorly supplied and armed. Russia's officer leadership 
					is quite poor and their people can barley afford to eat. Russia has also been just recently humiliated by Japan in the
					<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Japanese_War"> Russo-Japanese War </a> and had its navy annihilated. Russia's industry is 
					lackluster and the majority of its economy comes from agriculture. <br> <br>
					
					During WW1, their main ability is sheer size, in both manpower and area. They were able to retreat deep inside their own territory,
					so deep that if it were any other country, they'd be conquered. Germany initially focused on France, but after failing to strike
					the killing blow, decided to fight Russia. Russia was able to fight back but had significantly more casualties. An example of this would be the 
					<a href = "battles.html/#brusilov">Brusilov Offensive</a>. Russia was also able to stalemate against the Ottomans to the south and inflicted 
					heavy casualties upon the Ottomans. In 1917, the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Revolution" >Russian Revolution</a> began and 
					Russia had to surrender to the Central Powers and was humiliated once again. Russia soon turned into a place of anarchy until the Soviet Union 
					was established.

					The German Empire was a relatively new nation that was established in 1871. 
					Under Prussia, the independent german states united together into one after 
					defeating France in the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Prussian_War">Franco-Prussian War</a>. The German Empire 
					rapidly rose to Great Power status and was a huge shock to Europe's balance of power. <br><br>
					
					The German Empire was new and powerful. Being formed under Prussia, they had a strong 
					military tradition. There was a saying that &quot;Prussia is not a state which possesses an army, 
					but an army which possesses a state.&quot; - Friedrich von Schr&ouml;tter. <br><br>

				<p class = "roboto">
					
					As WW1 broke out, Germany was able to swiftly and rapidly overrun its enemies using superior tactics, weaponry, leadership, and morale.
					However, Germany's assault on France in the Schlieffen plan <a href = "battles.html/#marne">failed to land a killing blow</a>
					and the battlefield stagnated with trench warfare.Germany invested in long-term trenches, significantly improoving their combat capabilities 
					compared to France and Britain which used more temporary trenches, believing that their assaults will break through any day.<br><br>
					
					Germany's allies were rather impotent in the war, forcing Germany to fight a two front war, one against France and UK, another against 
					Russia. Germany traditionally had a weak navy as the Prussian military was land-oriented. However, before WW1, Germany had begun to invest 
					heavily in a strong navy. This threatened the UK, but during the war, Britain's Royal Navy ultimately proved to be superior and was able to 
					blockade Germany, preventing the Germans from getting crucial supplies needed for war.

				<img src = "images/aushung_flag.jpg" alt = "A flag of Austria-Hungary" class = "nation-img">
				
				<p class = "roboto">
					The Austro-Hungarian empire was a multi-ethnic empire that was filled with internal unrest from nationalist movements. 
					Austria-Hungary used to be known as just the Austrian Empire, but after the
					<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austro-Hungarian_Compromise_of_1867">Austro-Hungarian compromise</a>, was turned into 
					a union between Austria and Hungary. <br><br>
					
					Europe in the 19th and first half of the 20th century was filled with nationalism where different people of different cultures 
					and ethnicities were heavily patriotic. This was a problem for the Austro-Hungarian empire, as they were a multi-ethnic empire 
					formed by subjugating and conquering lands from foreign nations. The nation was ununited, unco-ordinated, and filled with 
					unrest as nationalist movements to gain independence from Austria-Hungary formed and ethnic tensions increased.
					As a result, after the war ended in favour of the Entente/Allied Powers, Austria-Hungary was dismantled and countless minor nations in 
					the balkans were liberated. <br><br>

					In 1914 the heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, was assasinated by Bosnian nationalists. The Austrians 
					believed that Serbia was involved in the assasination and declared war. As a result, Serbia's ally Russia was called to join the war. 
					Austria-Hungary called Germany, and Russia then called France. There was a big chain of alliances being called because of the death 
					of the Austro-Hungarian heir.  <br><br>
					
					Austria-Hungary's role in the war was major but their performance was very lackluster. They were unable to perform effectively 
					against the Russian Empire and relied heavily upon Germany's support in the eastern front. The Austro-Hungarian empire also 
					struggled completely subduing the tiny nation of Serbia. The minor Central Power nation of Bulgaria was able to finally conquer 
					Serbia for Austria-Hungary. However, Austria-Hungary still had major troubles beating Italy, an entente power,in the war and they 
					ended up in a bloody stalemate.

				<p class = "roboto">
					The Ottoman Empire used to be feared and the most powerful nation in the  western world during the 17th century. 
					Over the ages, the Ottomans slowly declined - but never collapsed. They eventually dropped out of Great Power status.
					From 1912-1913, the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkan_Wars">Balkan Wars</a> occurred, resulting in the Ottoman
					Empire loosing all of its territory in the Balkans. <br><br>

				<br>
				
				
				<p class = "roboto">
					The Ottomans also lost land in north africa and Ottoman Egypt was occupied by the British Empire. As a result, the Ottomans wanted to regain 
					its former glory and weaken its rival to the north, the Russian Empire. The Ottomans had success in the early stages of the war, 
					repelling an attack from the UK in the <a href = "battles.html/gallipoli">Gallipoli campaign</a>. The Ottomans also were able to capture 
					Russian territory in the caucasus. <br><br>
					
					Later on in the war, the Ottomans held a stalemate against the Russians in the caucasus. Although it was a stalemate, the Ottomans suffered 
					far more casualties than the Russians. The Ottomans also had trouble against another British attack through the middle east in Iraq. The British
					were far more successful here and were able to capture important cities like Baghdad. <br><br>
					
					The Ottoman Empire unfortunately has committed the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_genocide">Armenian Genocide</a> from 
					1915-1917 in which they unfortunately murdered 600,000 - 1,500,000 Armenian civilians in cold blood.
