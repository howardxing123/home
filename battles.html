					The Battle of the Marne was fought from 5th to 14th of September, 1914 between the German Empire and a combined army of 
					French and British troops. The battle was located near the Marne river in France. The battle ended in victory of France
					and Britain. This battle resulted in the shift from maneuver warfare of the first few months of the war
					during the Schlieffen plan, into the deadly stalemate known as trench warfare.<br><br>

					The Germans were initially extremely successful in overrunning French forces in the Schlieffen plan by attacking through 
					Belgium, a neutral country. The Germans were approaching Paris and if they were to reach the French capital, the war 
					on the western front would be over. The Battle of the Marne occurred 40km away from Paris. French and British forces
					counterattacked German positions along the Marne river and were able to repel the Germans. This battle was an important 
					turning point and as such is also known as the "Miracle on the Marne".

					The Battle of Verdun was fought from 21st of February to 18th of December, 1916 between the German Empire and France. 
					The battle was located near the city of Verdun. The battle ended in a French victory. This was one of the largest battles of 
					the First World War. Millions of artillery shells were fired during the battle. Casualties were extremely high on both sides.<br><br>
					
					After the deadlock of trench warfare was formed, the Germans had realised that they could not decisively defeat the French so they 
					instead changed their strategy to attrition warfare (win the war by making the other side run out of manpower or resources). The Germans 
					decided to make the French &quot;bleed out&quot;. The Germans lured in French troops by launching a massive offensive against a heavily 
					fortified area near Verdun. <br><br>
					
					The Germans began their assault with massive artillery bombardments. The French were incredibly resilient and held their ground against 
					the German assault. The French general swapped troops from the front-line every once in a while to keep troops fresh. The French and Germans 
					continued fighting until it was clear that no progress was being made and committed their resources in other areas.

					The Battle of the Somme was fought from 1st of July to 18th of November, 1916. The battle was located near the Somme river. 
					The battle has no clear victor. This was one of the largest battles of the First World War. This was the battle where tanks 
					were first used in warfare. <br><br>
					
					As the Germans were launching a massive offensive at <a href = "#verdun">Verdun</a>, British and French forces decided to relieve pressure off 
					Verdun by launching their own assault at the Somme. Before the battle, Britain heavily bombarded German positions with limited success. 
					Britain conducted the initial attack, crossing no man's land, on German positions and suffered severe casualties. On the first day 
					of the Battle of the Somme, Britain suffered 60,000 casualties as troops were mowed down by machine guns and barbed wire. <br><br>
					
					The Battle of the Somme showed the true brutality of trying to attack fortified positions in trench warfare. The tanks that were 
					deployed had limited success. They intimidated German forces and were able to break through barbed wire and machine gun positions.
					However, the tanks were incredibly unreliable and broke down in the mud and were annihilated easily by artillery. Despite so many 
					losses in lives, no significant gains were made.

					The Battle of Vimy Ridge was fought from 9th to 12th of April, 1917.  The battle was located near Vimy in Pas de Calais. The battle was 
					won by Canadian troops, and thus the British Empire. This is the most famous battle that Canadians have played a major role in. 
					This battle is a smaller part of the Battle of Arras.<br><br>
					
					Vimy Ridge is an elevated fortified position held by German forces. The French and British armies have tried assaulting the ridge before, 
					but have failed. The Canadian Corps was tasked with capturing the Ridge due to its tactical importance. The Canadians utilised heavy 
					co-ordination and was able to perfect the creeping barrage (artillery bombardment that moves at the same speed as the infantry, allowing cover 
					for friendly infantry forces). <br><br>
					
					By the end, the Canadians were able to capture Vimy Ridge despite fierce resistance. Despite being on the offensive against fortified positions,
					Canadian troops were able to inflict more casualties and secure a victory. This resulted in the Battle of Vimy Ridge heavily raising Entente 
					morale and increasing the national identity of Canada.

					The Battle of Osowiec Fortress, also known as the Attack of the Dead Men, was fought on 6th of August, 1915. The battle was won by Russia and 
					was faught in Osowiec Fortress in northern Poland.
					Although this is a really minor battle, it is one of the most interesting battles in WW1. <br><br>
					
					Osowiec Fortress was a heavily defended fort held by Russia. The Germans on many occasions attempted to capture the fortress but failed. 
					On 6th of August, 1915, the Germans conducted another assault. They shelled the fortress with artillery and then used toxic gas to kill the 
					Russian defenders inside of the fort. Many of the Russians died from the toxic gas. <br><br>
					
					German soldiers attempted to capture the fort after the bombardment and gas attacks. However, the remaining Russian garrison did a massive 
					counterattack in a suicide charge. The Russian survivors were bleeding and coughing pieces of their own lungs due to the gas attacks. Their
					faces were covered with rotten flesh. The German soldiers thought they were zombies and were so scared they turned the other way and ran.

				<p class = "roboto rightimage">
					The Battle of Tannenberg was fought from 23rd to 30th of August, 1914. The battle ended in a crushing defeat for Russia, and a major victory 
					for Germany. The battle was faught near the city of Allenstein.
					This is one of the most one-sided battles of the entire war, with Russia suffering many times more casualties than Germany. 
					<br><br>
					
					At the start of the war, Germany concentrated most of its force in France in order to quickly knock it out in the Schlieffen plan. Russia 
					promised to mobilize 800,000 troops within 15 days of mobilization despite Russia's cumbersome size. Soon after, the Russians began an attack 
					on German territory in order to relieve pressure from France. Due to the sudden massive mobilization, Germany was caught by surprise at the 
					size of the Russian army and had to divert troops from France to Russia. Germany was able to crack Russia's encrypted radio and after the
					Russians realized, they decided to use the public radio instead and hoped that the Germans would just not pay attention.<br><br>
					
					The Russians outnumbered the Germans and planned on enveloping German forces with a pincer attack with the 1st and 2nd Armies. 
					However, the 1st Army had delayed the attack for a few days and the 2nd Army continued nonetheless. Germany was able to find out the movement 
					of Russian armies through the radio and with its superior rail system, co-ordination, and organization was able to engage the Russian army by 
					surprise. The Russians were unable to effectively fight back due to poor co-ordination, morale, and organization. As a result, they were 
					encircled and then utterly annihilated.

					The Gallipoli campaign was fought from 19th of February 1915, to 9th of January 1916. The campaign ended in victory for the Ottoman empire.
					The Gallipoli campaign were a series of battles faught in the Gallipoli peninsula, guarding the strait to the Ottoman capital of Istanbul. 
					<br><br>
					
					After the <a href = "#marne">Battle of the Marne</a>, Trench warfare started and the western front was locked in a stalemate. The Ottomans 
					were at war with the Russians and had captured land in the Caucausus. The British also wanted a way to supply the Russians through the Black 
					Sea. As a result, the British devised a plan to capture Istanbul and knock the Ottomans out of the war. However, British attempts to capture 
					Istanbul have failed due to sea mines and Ottoman defensive positions along the Gallipoli peninsula. <br><br>
					
					As a result, the British launched an amphibious assault on the Gallipoli peninsula. British troops landed in Gallipoli in wooden row boats and 
					created a naval beachhead. The French landed elsewhere as a diversion. The Entente forces were unable to make significant 
					progress, as the situation mirrored that of the western front with trench warfare occurring in Gallipoli too. The rugged terrain and high 
					temperatures made the situation worse. Entente casualties increased and with the lack of reinforcements, forced them to retreat
